# Baloonce!

Ready to test your communication skills and race against the clock? **Baloonce** is a vibrant two-player co-op game where you'll work together to place colorful balloons on their designated spots as fast as you can to snag a top spot on the leaderboard!

#### TL;DR

- Team up! Pick a name.
- Player 1 (screen) directs, Player 2 (camera) acts! 
- Fastest Top 10 challenge!

#### Here's how to play:

- **Team Up!** First, you and your partner will decide on a legendary team name.
- **Pick Your Side**: One player (Player 1) will be the "screen side" maestro, while the other (Player 2) takes on the "camera side" challenge.
- **The Clock Starts Now!** Player 1 enters your team name, hits 'Start,' and the timer begins its relentless tick-tock.
- **Visual Recon**: Player 1 will see an image of balloons in specific colored positions. Once you've got the layout memorized (no peeking for Player 2!), hit Enter. (You can go back, but remember, time is definitely not on your side!)
- **Verbal Gymnastics**: Now for the fun part! Player 1 needs to verbally guide Player 2 on where each colored balloon belongs. - Player 2, get ready to use your body and two hands â€“ no tables or other aids allowed! And a crucial rule: Player 1 (and anyone else) can't lend a helping hand.
- **Three Levels of Fun**: You'll repeat this balloon-matching challenge for three exciting levels. No switching players allowed, so get ready to bond!
- **Leaderboard Glory**: Once all three levels are complete, see if your team has the speedy skills to burst into the top 10 fastest teams!
