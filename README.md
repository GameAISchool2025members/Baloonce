# Baloonce for some reason

## TL;DR

- **Memorize & Replicate**: Accurately replicate the balloon arrangement and colors.
- **Hands Only**: Use both hands to hold the balloons; no body support is allowed at the final stage per level.
- **No Help**: This is an individual challenge; no external assistance is permitted.
- **Leaderboard**: The top 10+1 fastest participants will earn a spot on the leaderboard and **may** keep one balloon.

Here's how the game works:

- **Read the Rules**: Start by reviewing these instructions.
- **Memorize the Pattern**: You'll see a picture displaying colored circles, representing the balloons you need to arrange. Study it carefully!
- **Recreate the Shape**: The picture will disappear. Now, using your balloons, recreate the exact shape and color pattern you just saw.
- **Need a Peek?** If you need a reminder, you can look at the picture again, but do not touch the balloons while viewing the image.
- **Leaderboard**: The top 10+1 fastest players will secure a spot on the leaderboard!
